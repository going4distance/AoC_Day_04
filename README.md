Programmer's note:  Keep in mind when looking over the code, that the 2nd problem was not available to me, until after the 1st was completed.

Problem #1:\
Given a file consisting of unsorted records in the format of(year-month-day hour:minute):\
[1518-11-01 00:00] Guard #10 begins shift\
[1518-11-01 00:05] falls asleep\
[1518-11-01 00:25] wakes up\
[1518-11-02 00:50] wakes up\
[1518-11-01 23:58] Guard #99 begins shift\
[1518-11-02 00:40] falls asleep\
Find the guard that has the most minutes asleep. What minute does that guard spend asleep the most?
What is the ID of the guard you chose multiplied by the minute you chose?

Problem #2:\
Of all guards, which guard is most frequently asleep on the same minute?
What is the ID of the guard you chose multiplied by the minute you chose?
